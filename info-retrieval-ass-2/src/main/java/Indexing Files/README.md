# Assignment 2 - Indexing

includes source files for indexing THE 4 datasets and a sample query program to query these indexes. Each index will be stored in a separate folder

## Structure

- `/src`: Contains all the indexing  java files.
- `indexing.sh`: Shell script to run the indexing and querying processes.

## Running the Project

1. **Run the Shell Script**: 
   - Execute `./indexing.sh`

2. **Possible Issues**: 
   - If the code does not run as expected, ensure that the datasets are correctly pipelined through the arguments in the shell script.
   - Verify that the paths to the datasets are correctly specified in the shell script.
